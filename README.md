# Hi, I'm Juno!

I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Pennsylvania with a passion for developing innovative solutions in software engineering, data science, and machine learning. I'm interested in exploring applications of technology in both finance and music, taking advantage of signal processing!

## Projects

- **Pennstagram (NETS2120)**
  - Built a scalable Instagram-style web app supporting real-time social feed, image upload, and RAG chatbot by integrating React, Express.js, AWS S3, Kafka, and Langchain for full-stack architecture
  - Reduced image retrieval latency by 40% by using ChromaDB for vector similarity search
  - Enabled efficient personalized content ranking using Spark-based adsorption algorithm by processing graph data on Apache Spark and streaming updates with Kafka

- (WIP) **Stockify**
  - [Project Link](https://stockify-mocha.vercel.app/)
  - Building full stack app to simulate stock exchange for tracking music artist's popularity

- **Lockheed Martin Satellite Data Alignment Project**
  - Simulated co-alignment of AIA images to IRIS rasters for 100M+ solar scans by developing and training a U-Net CNN with LMSAL's high performance cluster
  - Increased raster analysis accuracy by 27% by using the simulated scans for extraction of physical variables used in various research studies
  - Developed co-alignment image training set of 80k+ solar scans by using OpenCV image analysis algorithms (SIFT, SURF, ORB)

- **DealScout**
  - Developed a Chrome extension that enhances Zillow property listings by scraping real estate data and computing valuations with Nextplace.ai
  - Secured $27K+ in grant funding by presenting the project at the 2025 Bittensor Endgame Summit, highlighting its value for decentralized real estate intelligence

- **Lucidity Chrome Extension**  
  - Created a productivity tool to block distracting websites, validated by a 24% boost in student productivity
  - Integrated ML for website classification, leading to a provisional patent application.
